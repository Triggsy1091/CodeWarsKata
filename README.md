# CodeWarsKata
This respository is a place to add Kata (problems) from the website "www.codewars.com". I am using this to publish my solutions, but also this is my first time using GitHub seriously, so I will also be learning this as I go.
Feel free to do whatever you like with this repository, maybe even add your own Kata solutions or new problems that you come up with. I am working in Python for these Kata, but any language is fine.

Any issues, advice, or feedback, let me know: ntriggs01@gmail.com
